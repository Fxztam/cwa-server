= Don't Log and Throw

== Status

Accepted

== Context

Exception handling and logging are closely related to each other and are important to properly track down issues in the field.

For an efficient root cause analysis exceptions must be handled, i.e. logged, at one place.
Otherwise, the log get's quickly polluted.
This is what is often referred to as an anti-pattern called "Log and Throw".

The current exception handling and logging contains exactly these situations, which lead to difficult root cause analysis of field issues.

== Decision

It's not allowed to catch an exception, log (no matter if only the message or the stacktrace) and rethrow it.

If an exception occurs at one place it needs to be decided, if the calling code can handle the exception properly.
If that's not the case, the exception needs to be propagated to the next higher level.

== Consequences

- Existing code needs to be checked to remove all implementations of the Log and Throw pattern
- New code must NOT implement the Log and Throw pattern:

[source,java]
----
try {
    // some functionality
} catch (AnyException e) {
    LOGGER.error("Something unexpected happened.", e);
    throw new IllegalStateException("Something unexpected happened", e);
}
----


[[adr:LogAndThrow]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint,requiresConcepts="adr:Logger",severity=minor]
.Reports all occurences of Log and Throw
----
MATCH  (exception:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(constructor:Constructor),
       (method:Method)-[newException:INVOKES]->(constructor)
WHERE  exception.fqn =~ ".*Exception"
WITH   method, newException
MATCH  (logger:Type:Logger)-[:DECLARES]->(logMethod:Method),
       (t:Type)-[:DECLARES]->(method)-[log:INVOKES]->(logMethod)
WHERE  logMethod.signature =~ ".*,java.lang.Throwable\\)"
       AND abs(log.lineNumber - newException.lineNumber) <= 4
RETURN t.fqn as DeclaringType, collect(distinct log.lineNumber) as LineNumber
